# election_2018_forcast

Here is my forcast. 

Democrats win the House by a very small margin, Republicans keep the Senate. 

Whilst FiveThirtyEight 80% chance Democrats gain 21 to 59 seats in the house, I think theres a high posibility that socioeconomic polarisation is still highly influencing political polarisation, and that high voter turn out numbers for this Midterm election also apply to the same voters that elected Trump in 2016, and are pleased -at the very least- with the tradgectory of the economy. Therefore the margin will not be as large as predicted. 

Given that in Texas' Senate race, Ted Cruz is a big favorite (84.4% chance) to beat Beto O'Rourke (20.7% chance) and in Missouri, Claire McCaskill is an underdog (45.5% chance) to retain her Senate seat vs. Josh Hawley (59.3% chanc) - the Republicans will retain the Senate.
